# LINEAR KEY Partitioning Type

### Syntax

```sql
LINEAR PARTITION BY KEY ([column_names])
[PARTITIONS (number_of_partitions)]
```

## Description

LINEAR KEY partitioning is a form of [partitioning](../), similar to [KEY partitioning](key-partitioning-type.md).

LINEAR KEY partitioning makes use of a powers-of-two algorithm, while KEY partitioning\
uses modulo arithmetic, to determine the partition number.

Adding, dropping, merging and splitting partitions is much faster than with the [KEY partitioning type](key-partitioning-type.md), however, data is less likely to be evenly distributed over the partitions.

## Example

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE t1 (v1 INT)
  PARTITION BY LINEAR KEY (v1)
  PARTITIONS 2;
```
