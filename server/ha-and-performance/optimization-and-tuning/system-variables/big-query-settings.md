# Big Query Settings

MariaDB 5.3 and beyond have a number of features that are targeted at big queries and so are disabled by default.

This page describes recommended settings for IO-bound queries that shovel through lots of records.

First, turn on Batched Key Access:

```sql
# Turn on disk-ordered reads
optimizer_switch='mrr=on'
optimizer_switch='mrr_cost_based=off'

# Turn on Batched Key Access (BKA)
join_cache_level = 6
```

Give BKA buffer space to operate on.\
Ideally, it should have enough space to fit all the data examined by the query.

```sql
# Size limit for the whole join
join_buffer_space_limit = 300M

# Limit for each individual table
join_buffer_size = 100M
```

Turn on [index\_merge/sort-intersection](../query-optimizations/index_merge-sort_intersection.md):

```sql
optimizer_switch='index_merge_sort_intersection=on'
```

If your queries examine big fraction of the tables (somewhere more than \~ 30%), turn on [hash join](https://app.gitbook.com/s/WCInJQ9cmGjq1lsTG91E/development-articles/mariadb-internals/mariadb-internals-documentation-query-optimizer/block-based-join-algorithms#block-hash-join):

```sql
# Turn on both Hash Join and Batched Key Access
join_cache_level = 8
```
