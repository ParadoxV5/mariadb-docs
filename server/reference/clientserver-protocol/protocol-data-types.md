# Protocol data types

## List of possible types

Unknown type:

|                                                         |                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| [byte<1>](protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-bytes)    | Fixed-length bytes       |
| [byte](protocol-data-types.md#length-encoded-bytes)     | Length-encoded bytes     |
| [byte](protocol-data-types.md#end-of-file-length-bytes) | End-of-file length bytes |

Integer type:

|                                                        |                         |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ----------------------- |
| [int<1>](protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-integers) | Fixed-length integers   |
| [int](protocol-data-types.md#length-encoded-integers)  | Length-encoded integers |

String type:

|                                                             |                            |
| ----------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| [string](protocol-data-types.md#fixed-length-strings)       | Fixed-length strings       |
| [string](protocol-data-types.md#null-terminated-strings)    | Null-terminated strings    |
| [string](protocol-data-types.md#length-encoded-strings)     | Length-encoded strings     |
| [string](protocol-data-types.md#end-of-file-length-strings) | End-of-file length strings |

### Fixed length bytes

The notation is "byte".

A fixed-length byte stores the value in a series of n bytes.

### Length encoded bytes

The notation is "byte".

Length encoded bytes are prefixed by a length-encoded integer which describes the length of the byte value, followed by the bytes value.

### End of file length bytes

The notation is "byte".

Bytes whose length will be calculated by the packet remaining length.

### Fixed length integers

Notation is "int".

A fixed-length integer stores the value in a series of n bytes. The least significant byte is\
always the first byte (little-endian format).

#### Example

An int<4> with value 2 is stored as`02 00 00 00`

### Length encoded integers

The notation is "int".

An integer which depending on its value is represented by n bytes.

The first byte represents the size of the integer:

If the value of first byte is

* < 0xFB - Integer value is this 1 byte integer
* 0xFB - NULL value
* 0xFC - Integer value is encoded in the next 2 bytes (3 bytes total)
* 0xFD - Integer value is encoded in the next 3 bytes (4 bytes total)
* 0xFE - Integer value is encoded in the next 8 bytes (9 bytes total)

### Fixed-length strings

The notation is "string".

Fixed-length strings have a known hardcoded length.

### Null-terminated strings

The notation is "string".

Null-terminated strings have a variable size and are terminated by a 0x00 character

### Length-encoded strings

The notation is "string".

Length-encoded strings are prefixed by a length-encoded integer which describes the length of the string, followed by the string value.

#### Example

An string of 512 "a" is encoded in 515 bytes :

|                                                 |                                |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| fc 00 02 97 97 97 97 97 97 97 97 97 97 97 97 97 | ² .. a a a a a a a a a a a a a |

...\
The NULL value is encoded using null (0xfb) length.

An empty value is encoded with a 0 (0x00) length.

### End of file length strings

The notation is "string".

Strings whose length is calculated by the packet remaining length.

For an example, see the [COM\_STMT\_PREPARE](3-binary-protocol-prepared-statements/com_stmt_prepare.md) packet.
