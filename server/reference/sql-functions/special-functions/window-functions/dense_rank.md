# DENSE\_RANK

## Syntax

```sql
DENSE_RANK() OVER (
  [ PARTITION BY partition_expression ]
  [ ORDER BY order_list ]
)
```

## Description

`DENSE_RANK()` is a [window function](./) that displays the number of a given row, starting at one and following the [ORDER BY](../../../sql-statements/data-manipulation/selecting-data/order-by.md) sequence of the window function, with identical values receiving the same result. Unlike the [RANK()](rank.md) function, there are no skipped values if the preceding results are identical. It is also similar to the [ROW\_NUMBER()](row_number.md) function except that in that function, identical values will receive a different row number for each result.

## Examples

The distinction between `DENSE_RANK()`, [RANK()](rank.md) and [ROW\_NUMBER()](row_number.md):

```sql
CREATE TABLE student(course VARCHAR(10), mark int, name varchar(10));

INSERT INTO student VALUES 
  ('Maths', 60, 'Thulile'),
  ('Maths', 60, 'Pritha'),
  ('Maths', 70, 'Voitto'),
  ('Maths', 55, 'Chun'),
  ('Biology', 60, 'Bilal'),
   ('Biology', 70, 'Roger');

SELECT 
  RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY course ORDER BY mark DESC) AS rank, 
  DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY course ORDER BY mark DESC) AS dense_rank, 
  ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY course ORDER BY mark DESC) AS row_num, 
  course, mark, name 
FROM student ORDER BY course, mark DESC;
+------+------------+---------+---------+------+---------+
| rank | dense_rank | row_num | course  | mark | name    |
+------+------------+---------+---------+------+---------+
|    1 |          1 |       1 | Biology |   70 | Roger   |
|    2 |          2 |       2 | Biology |   60 | Bilal   |
|    1 |          1 |       1 | Maths   |   70 | Voitto  |
|    2 |          2 |       2 | Maths   |   60 | Thulile |
|    2 |          2 |       3 | Maths   |   60 | Pritha  |
|    4 |          3 |       4 | Maths   |   55 | Chun    |
+------+------------+---------+---------+------+---------+
```
