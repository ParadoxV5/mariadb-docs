interfaces, libraries and APIs that exist in MySQL also exist in MariaDB.

* [OLD\_MODE](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/server-management/variables-and-modes/old-mode), to emulate behavior from old MySQL/MariaDB versions.
* [EXTRACT (HOUR FROM ...)](https://app.gitbook.com/s/SsmexDFPv2xG2OTyO5yV/reference/sql-functions/date-time-functions/extract) now adheres to the SQL standard and returns values from 0 to 23. Previously it could return greater values.

  * [CVE-2014-0437](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0437)
  * [CVE-2014-0420](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2014-0420)
